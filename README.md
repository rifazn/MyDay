# MyDay
A repo to track what I need to do, and what I have done in the day.

# Today I Learned
- Sites like [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) and [PeerTube](https://peertube.cpy.re/) are not made using "blockchain" but made using [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub). Its a w3c standard protocol for making decentralized websites. I'll be using this to make my System Analysis and Design course's project. tags: #uni #sad #activitypub
- The colors that you get in your bash prompt depend on what a certain color is defined as in your Terminal Emulators theme. For example, color1 and color9 defined in your terminal'r preferences is responsible for "red" in your bash colors. So if you want red (\e\[0;31m) in your bash prompt, you might actually get black if color1 and color9 are defined as #000000 in your terminal config. tags: #bash #terminal #termite
